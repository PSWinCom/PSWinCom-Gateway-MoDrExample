PSWinCom-Gateway-MoDrExample
============================

This example uses a simple .aspx page and the PSWinCom .Net SDK client to handle MO and DR requests.

Prerequisites:
You must have an account at PSWinCom Gateway.
The sample must be deployed at a public website accessible from the internet. 
Either a MO SMS keyword, DR forwarding, or both, must be setup for your account. This is done in the PSWinCom Accountweb, and PSWinCom Support will help you with this.
